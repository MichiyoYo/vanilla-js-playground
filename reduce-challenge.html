HOME ABOUT RESUME CONTACT
Cristina D. Lester
I’m an analyst programmer with 8+ years of experience in front-end/back- end web development, system management, maintenance and more! I’ve been working in companies and as a freelancer using different platforms, tools and languages. I enjoy being challenged and working on projects that require me to work outside my comfort zone and knowledge set.
Let's start scrolling and learn more about me.


About Me
My name is Cristina Lester, I'm 33 years old, native Italian, I live in Los Angeles. I studied Computer Science at University of Pisa. The training I received has been a solid base to build my first freelance projects and achieve my first goals as a young developer. Now I have more than 8 years of professional experience as frontend/backend web developer, webmaster, system administrator and performance analyst. I love to grow and learn from my job, experiment with new technologies and languages, share my skills and achieve new goals. I am an extremely fast learner, I don't feel confined to the skill set that I already have, instead I always look for an opportunity to expand it. I like to be challenged. I spent my entire career debugging code, fix issues, find the best solution to every problem that would be presented to me. My ideal job would be a point of junction between coding and art, something that would let me express my creativity and be satisfyingly rewarding. I love to work in teams, to communicate with my teammates and build a professional relationship with them that fortifies the team work. I speak Italian (native), English (fluent). I'm also a Bass Player, Digital Illustrator, Gourmet Cook, Fitness Fan, Yoga Student.
